                Kem is a Warsaw-based feminist and queer group active since 2016 and focused on choreography and
                performance, as well as experiments with formats and queer pleasure. It is a community created in the
                process of collaboration and engagement with the politics of embodiment, affect and subjectivity in
                relation to collectivity. Kem is characterised by hybridity and fluidity, blurring the boundaries
                between art, curating, education activism clubbing and community-making practices.
