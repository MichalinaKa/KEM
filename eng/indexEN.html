            Kem is a Warsaw-based feminist and queer group active since 2016 and focused on choreography and
            performance, as well as experiments with formats and queer pleasure. It is a community created in the
            process of collaboration and engagement with the politics of embodiment, affect and subjectivity in
            relation to collectivity. Kem is characterised by hybridity and fluidity, blurring the boundaries
            between art, curating, education activism clubbing and community-making practices.
